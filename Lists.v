       We can make a little progress by using the IH to rewrite the 
       goal... *)
    rewrite <- IHl'.

(** For comparison, here are informal proofs of these two theorems: 

    _Theorem_: For all numbers [n] and lists [l],
       [length (snoc l n) = S (length l)].
 
    _Proof_: By induction on [l].

    - First, suppose [l = []].  We must show
        length (snoc [] n) = S (length []),
      which follows directly from the definitions of
      [length] and [snoc].

    - Next, suppose [l = n'::l'], with
        length (snoc l' n) = S (length l').
      We must show
        length (snoc (n' :: l') n) = S (length (n' :: l')).
      By the definitions of [length] and [snoc], this
      follows from
        S (length (snoc l' n)) = S (S (length l')),
]] 
      which is immediate from the induction hypothesis. [] *)
                        
(** _Theorem_: For all lists [l], [length (rev l) = length l].
    
    _Proof_: By induction on [l].  

      - First, suppose [l = []].  We must show
          length (rev []) = length [],
        which follows directly from the definitions of [length] 
        and [rev].
    
      - Next, suppose [l = n::l'], with
          length (rev l') = length l'.
        We must show
          length (rev (n :: l')) = length (n :: l').
        By the definition of [rev], this follows from
          length (snoc (rev l') n) = S (length l')
        which, by the previous lemma, is the same as
          S (length (rev l')) = S (length l').
        This is immediate from the induction hypothesis. [] *)

(** Obviously, the style of these proofs is rather longwinded
    and pedantic.  After the first few, we might find it easier to
    follow proofs that give a little less detail overall (since we can
    easily work them out in our own minds or on scratch paper if
    necessary) and just highlight the non-obvious steps.  In this more
    compressed style, the above proof might look more like this: *)

(** _Theorem_:
     For all lists [l], [length (rev l) = length l].

    _Proof_: First, observe that
       length (snoc l n) = S (length l)
     for any [l].  This follows by a straightforward induction on [l].
     The main property now follows by another straightforward
     induction on [l], using the observation together with the
     induction hypothesis in the case where [l = n'::l']. [] *)

(** Which style is preferable in a given situation depends on
    the sophistication of the expected audience and on how similar the
    proof at hand is to ones that the audience will already be
    familiar with.  The more pedantic style is a good default for
    present purposes. *)
